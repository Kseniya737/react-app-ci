  Scenario: as a user I can populate login details leveraging environment variables
    Given I am on the "home" page
    And I click the "playground" button
    When I am directed to the "playground" page
    And I fill in the "email" input with "$.TEST_EMAIL"
    And I fill in the "password" input with "$.TEST_PASSWORD"
    And the "email" should contain the value "admin@testingtalkshub.con.au"
    And the "password" should contain the value "Password1234"
